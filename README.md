# nwm_nyc_coworking_map

A comprehensive listing and interactive map of every coworking space in the NYC Metro Area, including the 5 boroughs of Manhattan plus nearby New Jersey, Westchester and Long Island.

This resource was created in February 2016 and is hosted and maintained by New Worker Magazine. Open source collaboration welcome.


Problem: There has never been a comprehensive map of greater NYC's coworking spaces. What maps exist are either incomplete, only focus on Manhattan locations, or are woefully out of date. 

Solution: A comprehensive map and listing for the entirety of Greater NYC. The creator of this map has amassed a comprehensive list of every relevant coworking space through (ugh!) years of research and data collection, and has continued to do so since 2014, leading us to believe we stand a good chance of keeping this resource sufficiently updated. ;)
